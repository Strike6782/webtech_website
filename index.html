                        The Hunger Games is a 2008 dystopian young adult novel by the American writer Suzanne Collins. It is written in the perspective of 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives in the future, post-apocalyptic nation of Panem in North America. The Capitol, a highly advanced metropolis, exercises political control over the rest of the nation. The Hunger Games is an annual event in which one boy and one girl aged 12â€“18 from each of the twelve districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to compete in a televised battle royale to the death.

                        Just epic. all the books are amazing but my favorite has got to be catching fire. the films are not as good as the books but still worth a watch. 12+ is the right age rating in my opinion. And do mention about the 13th district in the caption please.

                        Collins was the youngest of four children. Because her father was a career officer in the U.S. Air Force, the family moved frequently, and she spent time in Indiana and Belgium before graduating from high school in Birmingham, Alabama.
