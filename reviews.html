              The fact that so many adults believe this book is “about” kids killing kids is really an issue. This book creates empathy by creating characters that show themes of poverty and government control. Is there violence? Yes. It is used as a warning about becoming desensitized to violence. If you are not capable of understanding the messages in this book, please don’t speak on what it is “about”. The inability for adults to understand this is what is wrong with our society. Learning about characters teaches empathy.

              Children killing children is a gross, repulsive idea. I see that as an attitude that can only make our society indifferent to the suffering and death of our fellow human beings. Where are the uplifting and inspiring stories that can help our kids become moral, compassionate citizens?            </p>

              This book is great!! I read it when i was nine (no longer 9), though there are are heavy topics. Warnings: kissing, death, so forth. This book has amazingly real feeling characters. It has a great storyline and is always exciting

              Just epic. all the books are amazing but my favorite has got to be catching fire. the films are not as good as the books but still worth a watch. 12+ is the right age rating in my opinion. And do mention about the 13th district in the caption please.
