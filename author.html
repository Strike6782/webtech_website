                <h1>About the author: Suzanne Collins</h1>
                <img src="images/Suzanne-Collins.jpg" alt="Suzanne Collins, writer of the book" style="width: 25%">
                <p>Collins was the youngest of four children. Because her father was a career officer in the U.S. Air Force, the family moved frequently, and she spent time in Indiana and Belgium before graduating from high school in Birmingham, Alabama. After studying theatre and telecommunications at Indiana University (B.A., 1985), Collins received an M.F.A. in dramatic writing from New York University (1989). In the 1990s she wrote primarily for television, first for the short-lived sitcom Hi Honey, I’m Home! and then for several youth-oriented series (such as Clarissa Explains It All) on the Nickelodeon network. She later served as head writer of the PBS animated children’s show Clifford’s Puppy Days.</p>
                <p>While continuing to work in television, Collins conceived the children’s novel Gregor the Overlander (2003), about an 11-year-old boy in New York City drawn into a fantastic subterranean world where humans coexist with giant anthropomorphic sewer dwellers such as rats and cockroaches. The book was commended for its vivid setting and sense of adventure, and four additional installments (2004–07) in what became known as the Underland Chronicles soon followed. Despite the series’ intended audience, Collins—influenced by the lessons her father had taught her as a military historian and a Vietnam War veteran—straightforwardly introduced to its narrative such grim “adult” issues as genocide and biological warfare.</p>
                <p>Brutal combat and its consequences were also central concerns of The Hunger Games (2008), a dystopian tale in which two dozen adolescents are compelled by a futuristic authoritarian state to fight to the death in a televised competition. Inspired equally by reality television and Classical mythology, the novel, aimed at teenage readers, attracted intense interest in the plight of its headstrong 16-year-old heroine, Katniss Everdeen. As Collins extended the narrative with Catching Fire (2009) and Mockingjay (2010), the series became a mainstay on best-seller lists, especially in the United States, and also caught on with adults, a development that provoked comparisons to the broadly popular Harry Potter and Twilight novels. Critics as well as fans admired Collins’s ability to sustain a gripping plot, which was stimulated in part by an ongoing love triangle, while also engaging in a meaningful social critique of power and violence. In 2020 Collins published the prequel The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.</p>
                <p>A film adaptation of The Hunger Games, for which Collins wrote much of the screenplay, enjoyed enormous commercial success upon its release in 2012. By that time more than 30 million copies of the series were in print in the United States alone, and e-book sales were particularly robust. Adaptations of the second and third books appeared in 2013, 2014, and 2015; Mockingjay was released in two parts. In addition, Collins was the author of the children’s books When Charlie McButton Lost Power (2005) and Year of the Jungle: Memories from the Home Front (2013).</p>
